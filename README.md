## What is firebase ?
Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps.

Firebase provides tools and serviced such as:
- Analytics
- Authentication
- Cloud functions
- Realtime database
- Crashlytics
- Performance monitoring, and much more...!

and all this serverless.

## Why use Firebase ?

- It is less technical and time-saving alternative to writing full-fledged backend code for dynamic apps.
- You might also want to consider leveraging this tool if you eventually wish to host and manage your app in the cloud.
- Being serverless, Firebase removes the need to worry about the technicalities of cloud server configuration.
- It gives easy access to connect and use built-in third-party authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, among others.
- Low cost as firebase pricing is flexible and has pay-as-you-go services as well.
- Firebase is a good choice if you want to deploy a working product on the cloud rapidly.
